# HarmonicJumps
Tool to find harmonizing Tracks and potential paths lying between them using BFS.

Includes a command line and a GUI version, and requires providing a (backup) rekordbox database.
A feature to pull the currently playing track from rekordbox and using it as the origin track in the search is planned as well.
